Was it ethically unsound or was it the overbearing deference, even fear, with which French journalists approach the political class? British journalists have no such 'respect' for politicians as former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown found to his cost during the 2010 UK general election. \r\nHe had just spoken to a woman in the street and didn't realise that a microphone he was wearing was still live. After getting into his car he called her \"A bigoted woman.\" It certainly didn't help his election prospects. \r\nSarkozy and Brown are far from being the only world leaders to put their feet in their mouths. One of the most famous examples is a recording of US president Ronald Reagan warming up for a radio broadcast and not realising the microphones were live: \r\n\"My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.\"\r\nSo what do you think of today's story? Should these gaffes by politicians be made public or should journalists respect a certain amount of private space? Is it unprofessional of politicians to talk this way or entirely natural?\r\nWrite to us in English!\r\nprog\r\nprog\r\nاستمعmp3.لاستخدام هذا الملف لابد من تشغيل برنامج النصوص \"جافا\"، وأحدث الإصدارات من برنامج \"فلاش بلاير\"\r\nأحدث إصدارات برنامج \"فلاش بلاير\" متاحة هنااعرض الملف في مشغل آخر\r\ngaffes\r\nأخطاء \r\nout in the open\r\nفي العلن \r\nexasperation\r\nغضب \r\nethically unsound\r\nغير سوي أخلاقيا \r\nthe throne\r\nاحترام شديد \r\noverbearing deference\r\nاحترام شديد \r\nlive\r\nمباشر \r\nbigoted\r\nمتعصب \r\nput their feet in their mouths\r\nيقول شيئا محرجا \r\nwarming up\r\nيستعد \r\nwords\r\nwords\r\nاستمعmp3.لاستخدام هذا الملف لابد من تشغيل برنامج النصوص \"جافا\"، وأحدث الإصدارات من برنامج \"فلاش بلاير\"\r\nأحدث إصدارات برنامج \"فلاش بلاير\" متاحة هنااعرض الملف في مشغل آخر\r\nYour comments\r\n*Required Fields\r\nYour Feedback:Your Contact Details:\r\nName:\r\n  \r\nEmail *\r\n  \r\nTown, Country\r\n  \r\nTelephone\r\n   Your Message:\r\nComment * \r\n (500 maximum characters)  Disclaimer: \r\nI do not mind being contacted back by the BBC in relation to this comment.","creator_id":1,"presentationStyle":1}
