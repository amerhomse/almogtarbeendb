Bahrain needed to beat Indonesia by a nine goal margin in Manama to stand a chance of reaching the next round of the qualification process for the 2014 World Cup. \r\nThe ten-nil rout almost sent them through as runners up in the group, but they also required Qatar to lose in Iran, a match which was drawn. Indonesia had already been eliminated, and they fielded a relatively inexperienced team, but the heavy defeat was still unexpected. \r\nTheir goalkeeper was sent off early in the game and the referee awarded the home side four penalties. FIFA, which has a special match fixing department, has pledged to crack down on corruption in the game. \r\nEarly stages of international tournaments have been identified as possible targets for illegal gambling syndicates. The Asian Football Confederation said initial reports from the match officials have indicated that nothing was suspicious. \r\nIn Indonesia anger has been directed at the team and the country's football authorities. It follows a divisive period in which a rebel elite league was created. It almost led to a FIFA ban last year.\r\nraised eyebrows\r\nأثارت الاستغراب\r\nrout\r\nانهزام\r\nrunners up\r\nمرشع\r\neliminated\r\nأخرج\r\nunexpected\r\nغير متوقع\r\ncrack down\r\nمكافحة - محاربة\r\ncorruption\r\nفسـاد \r\nsuspicious\r\nمثير للشبهات\r\ndivisive\r\nمؤدٍ للنقسام\r\nelite\r\nالنخبة \r\nYour comments\r\n*Required Fields\r\nYour Feedback:Your Contact Details:\r\nName:\r\n  \r\nEmail *\r\n  \r\nTown, Country\r\n  \r\nTelephone\r\n   Your Message:\r\nComment * \r\n (500 maximum characters)  Disclaimer: \r\nI do not mind being contacted back by the BBC in relation to this comment.","creator_id":1,"presentationStyle":1}
