Professor Shane Houston, a deputy vice chancellor at the university, said it had been a day of mixed emotions.\r\n\"Aboriginal communities will remember the torment that many of our people have endured, and in some cases still do. But there is celebration of the fact that these ancestors are returning home,\" he said.\r\n\"So, it is an incredibly moving ceremony for people but one of incredible pride - the opportunity for people to embrace ancestors and carry them home is one that they take with great respect but great pride.\"\r\nCampaigners here in Australia continue to lobby museums and colleges overseas to return their collections of indigenous skeletons.\r\nThousands of bones and skulls are thought to be in the hands of foreign institutions, although many remains have been repatriated in recent years.\r\nWhat do you think of this story?
