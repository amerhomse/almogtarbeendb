Sean has a knack for dancing as does Mitch, but Mitchell decides to start a trucking business and relegate dance to being simply a hobby. Sean believes that dance is his big ticket, and eventually he gets a break by landing a spot in a big Sydney dance show. Things get even more complicated when both brothers fall for Linda (Sophie Lee), who Sean returns one day to find her in bed with Mitch. And even more so when Sean gets kicked off his spot in the Sydney show. Now he has to come up with something completely original, a cutting-edge dance show, that will help lift his spirits after his heartbreak over Linda, as well as silence his doubters. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStarring:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Directed by:  Dein Perry\r\n\r\n  Rating:  R for language, some violence and a scene of sexuality.","creator_id":1,"presentationStyle":1}
