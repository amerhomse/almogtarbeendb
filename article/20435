It means that their healthy organs can be given to people in need of a transplant. \r\nSome people decide to donate an organ while they're still alive. They are known as a 'live donor' or an 'altruistic donor'\r\nIt's not common at all. In fact for many years it was against the law to give up your organs while you were still alive. It was only legalised in the UK five years ago when doctors were finally convinced that live donations were both safe and ethical. \r\nHelen Marston is donating one of her kidneys to a complete stranger. Here she explains her decision: \r\n\"Well it seemed a very obvious thing to do, to me. I have two kidneys. I don't need two kidneys; I only need one. Yet there are many people who are desperately in need of a kidney. And I knew that I could make a difference, a very big difference, to someone else. \" \r\nThere's absolutely no contact between the person who donates the kidney and the person receiving the transplant. The person who receives Helen's kidney will never know who donated it. Helen can't choose who will get her kidney and will never know their name. Therecipient will never know who donated it. \r\nSo what do you think about organ donation? Is it a common thing where you are? Do you think it should be encouraged? And what about live donors?\r\nWrite to us in English!\r\nLive organ donation\r\nListen to the programme\r\nاستمعmp3.لاستخدام هذا الملف لابد من تشغيل برنامج النصوص \"جافا\"، وأحدث الإصدارات من برنامج \"فلاش بلاير\"\r\nأحدث إصدارات برنامج \"فلاش بلاير\" متاحة هنااعرض الملف في مشغل آخر\r\norgan donors\r\nمتبرع بالأعضاء \r\na transplant\r\nزرع الأعضاء \r\nto donate\r\nالتبرع \r\na live donor\r\nمتبرع حي \r\nan altruistic donor\r\nمتبرع غيري، متبرع إيثاري \r\nlegalised\r\nيشرع، يقونن \r\nethical\r\nأخلاقي \r\na complete stranger\r\nغريب تماماً \r\ndesperately in need of\r\nبحاجة ماسة إلى \r\nmake a difference\r\nيحدث تغييراً \r\nthe recipient\r\nالمتلقي \r\nLive organ donation\r\nListen to the words\r\nاستمعmp3.لاستخدام هذا الملف لابد من تشغيل برنامج النصوص \"جافا\"، وأحدث الإصدارات من برنامج \"فلاش بلاير\"\r\nأحدث إصدارات برنامج \"فلاش بلاير\" متاحة هنااعرض الملف في مشغل آخرYour comments\r\n*Required Fields\r\nYour Feedback:Your Contact Details:\r\nName:\r\n  \r\nEmail *\r\n  \r\nTown, Country\r\n  \r\nTelephone\r\n   Your Message:\r\nComment * \r\n (500 maximum characters)  Disclaimer: \r\nI do not mind being contacted back by the BBC in relation to this comment.","creator_id":1,"presentationStyle":1}
