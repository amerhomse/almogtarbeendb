He portrayed Greg Focker, a well intentioned husband-to-be determined to impress his fianc�e�s wealthy father.  No matter how hard Greg tried, however, his attempts to earn dad�s respect always proved disastrous.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorst Week, a program inspired by a similarly titled British sitcom, follows the same premise.  One key difference though is that while Greg Focker stayed only a weekend with his future father-in-law, Worst Week�s Sam Briggs (Kyle Bornheimer) has moved in indefinitely.  He is accompanied by his prospective wife, Melanie Clayton (Erinn Hayes), and both are concealing a big secret: Melanie is already pregnant.  That may be a significant surprise for the Briggs� no-nonsense patriarch, Dick (Kurtwood Smith of That '70s Show fame) and matriarch Angela (Nancy Lenehan).    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the tradition of programs like The King of Queens and Everybody Loves Raymond this UK import maintains the concept of an �everyman:� the average guy who loves his family, but for some reason repeatedly gets into trouble.  The pilot episode follows Sam as he accidentally urinates in a cooking pot containing the evening�s dinner, but not before a drunken coworker vomits all over him and Dick overhears a potential domestic assault in the making.  These situations would ordinary be horrible, yet beneath the surface lies Sam�s childlike naivety and subsequent chuckles ensue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCritics generally responded favorably to Worst Week, and the sitcom even garnered a People�s Choice Award nomination.  Despite a very short run, public interest in the show warranted the release of season one on DVD.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYear: 2008-09\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuration: 30 minutes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStarring: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKyle Bornheimer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nErinn Hayes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKurtwood Smith\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNancy Lenehan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreated By: Mark Bussell & Justin Sbresni\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRating: TV-14","creator_id":1,"presentationStyle":1}
