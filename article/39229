He said there was a lack of coordination between governments, aid donors and the UN's agencies, like the World Food Programme. Mr Gates called for the setting up of what he called a \"public score card\" system. This would make it easier to tell how well, or how badly, different countries and agencies were performing in the fight to reduce poverty. \r\nHe said the effort to help small farmers also needs to harness the power of advances made in digital technology. In an age when satellites can tell instantly exactly how much wheat is in a field, he said, it was a shame that people were still being sent out with pen, and paper and tape measures to try to do the same job. \r\nMr Gates said that the stakes couldn't be higher for the families of poor farmers. If they don't benefit from the fruits of the digital revolution they will fall far behind. But Mr Gates believes that if they can be connected to some of the latest breakthroughs in science they will have a chance to leapfrogforward.\r\nphilanthropist\r\nمحب للخير \r\nagencies\r\nوكالات \r\nsetting up\r\nيؤسس\r\nscore card\r\nبطاقة تنقيط\r\nharness\r\nيستغل\r\ndigital technology\r\nالتكنولوجيا الرقمية\r\na shame\r\nمخجل\r\nthe stakes\r\nالمخاطر\r\nthe fruits of\r\nثمرة ل\r\nleapfrog\r\nتقدم إلى الأمام\r\nYour comments\r\n*Required Fields\r\nYour Feedback:Your Contact Details:\r\nName:\r\n  \r\nEmail *\r\n  \r\nTown, Country\r\n  \r\nTelephone\r\n   Your Message:\r\nComment * \r\n (500 maximum characters)  Disclaimer: \r\nI do not mind being contacted back by the BBC in relation to this comment.","creator_id":1,"presentationStyle":1}
