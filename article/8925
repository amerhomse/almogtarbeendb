But new research suggests that some of this advice is outdated and occasionally even dangerous. \r\n39 per cent of mums surveyed by parenting website Netmums said they had been given advice from a family member that put their child at risk. \r\nAnd it seems the worst offenders are their own mother-in-law. \r\nSome of the more outlandish advice found in the survey includes an old tip about putting whisky on a baby’s gums to help them with teething. \r\nAnother rather strange piece of advice included putting a small piece of soap in a baby’s bottom to ‘help with constipation’. \r\nNetmums founder Siobhan Freegard described these outdated tips as “nuggets of advice handed down from generation to generation.” \r\nShe told the BBC that part of the problem could be to do with modern living.\r\nShe said that many of us live far away from our families, so now mums are more likely to get advice over the phone instead of watching and learning from their own parents.\r\nBut Siobhan says that “every baby is different” and that “it’s OK to go back and trust your own instincts”. \r\nHave you received advice that has been good or bad? And what is your advice to other new mums?
