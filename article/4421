In fact, I will let the Americans to be the judge of that. First, my questions are simple: Why you find the majority of American Muslims below the poverty level and why they lack any presentation and they are not part of the American motif and social being?\n \nBear in mind, every Muslim house is a mosque and even every clean land is a place to worship but the general problem is how to let the general public know and respect that.\n \nWe do not have proper channels to educate, explain and work with the Muslim minorities and their social difficulties and especially in the educational program as well as the social program provided for them.\n \nMost Muslim Americans feel neglected, discriminated against and their voices are ignored and black mailed as if they have done wrong or participated in the wrong act against their country the US.\n \nMuslim Americans have a lot of grounds to cover and the most important things to do are to communicate with the fellow Americans in order to bridge the cultural void and the cultural gap and to explain that we are no difference than any body else and that we believe in one creator, The Almighty Lord, The Lord of Adam and Eve all through to Moses, Messiah and Mohamed. I do not think the problem of building the mosque on the ground zero or any other mosque anywhere else has to do with anything related to religion but it has to do with everything called the unknown about Muslims, who they are, their way of living and their contribution to society and American Muslims in specific as of any minority in the US. Keep in mind, the mosque is a place for worshiping, religious guidance if needed and religious ceremonies but it is not the voice of individual Muslims. \n \nMuslim Americans come form different countries with different languages, cultures and costumes and the common thread between them all is their belief in Islam as their guidance in this life according to the laws of Allah and that include how to behave toward each others, their neighbors, community and the world at large with a certain self ruling and judging with what is admissible and what is prohibited to include what to eat and drink for example and what to wear and not to wear to make their lives spiritually organized, clean and fruitful here and here after.\n \n It does not mean if you are a Muslim that you are not a sociable person or you are not an educated person or that you are not a part of the American society at large. On the contrary, you will find that the Muslim Americans are artists, writers, engineers, doctors, scientists, business people, athletes, actors, singers and many others but we do not know them as Americans due to the lack of open communications and understanding between the Muslim individuals and the general public and I blame that on the failure of Muslim individuals to speak out and to write in all the fields in a more personal base and to be engaging with the American people and discussing with them their personal difficulties or success. \n \nThey do not need anybody to present them or to mediate for them but instead they need to be speaking out and to seek the equal justice provided by the law and the constitution for them and not to be afraid of intimidation or prosecution to speak their mind and speak the truth. They are Muslim Americans and the constitution protects them with freedom of religion, freedom of speech and even freedom of assembly.\n \nI wish that the Americans and leaders be more supportive and tolerant to Muslims, loving and welcoming them, not to discriminate against them, to include them in the process of policy making, to see more of fellow Muslims in the civil or governmental jobs and to see more programs recognizing the need of the minority Muslims in the US. I even encourage the building of multi cultural centers to exhibit and show the diversities, love for others and what this culture is all about and the major businesses in the industry to provide more halal products and to serve with halal products for the 6 million Muslims in this country and for 1.6 billion Muslims around the world.\nAnd not to judge the Muslims in general by the criminal acts of the insignificant few claiming to be Muslims.\n \nWritten by Ahmed A Jadallah\nبقلم احمد علي جادالله\n9/14/2010","creator_id":1,"presentationStyle":1}
