He says that swear words are now so common that they no longer cause distress. \r\nA man was fined $80 for swearing at police while they were searching him for drugs. But the judge removed the fine. He said the police officers would not have been alarmed or distressed by the swear words. \r\nJonathan Green, the author of a dictionary of slang, says that swear words don't carry much weight any more \r\n\"I don't feel that most people are shocked by this stuff. I really don't feel that these words carry so much weight any more. I would also suggest that in the question of the young man who's using them – he's not swearing, as it were; this is punctuation in his normal speech.\" \r\nSome people disagree with Jonathan Green, though. Simon Reed from the UK Police Federation says that the increase of swearing demonstrates a lack of respect for other people. \r\n\"We've almost lost now any respect for anyone else. Now if you're going to use that in front of police officers who are there to uphold the law, what message does that now send to anyone else?\" \r\nIs swearing increasing where you are?
