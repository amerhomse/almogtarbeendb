To realize her dream, however, she must enter law school, a task she cannot realize in her native country, let alone her preferred destination � America. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSofia relocates to the United States with her cousin Monica, who dreams of becoming a professional singer, but needs a green card to live in the US.  Like many impoverished immigrants with genuine aspirations, Monica marries to obtain residency.  The husband in this case understands that their union is merely for business and Monica agrees to exchange her love until she can obtain citizenship.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first Sofia hopes to find a legitimate way to attend law school; eventually, though, she follows in her cousin's footsteps and ties the knot with Jesse.  Unfortunately the faux-marriage turns south quickly: Jesse, along with his friends, steal all of Sofia's possessions, max out her credit cards, empty her savings account, and then threaten to sic the immigration authorities on her.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe is crushed, but thankfully still has Monica's emotional support.  Later on the group go dancing in an attempt to forget their recent misfortune but have a car accident on the way home, in which Sofia�s car is totaled. But it seems every cloud has a silver lining and when the victims of the accident discover Sofia does not have car insurance, they offer her a strange ultimatum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHelen and Frank Bauman agree to give the aspiring law student $50,000 if she will carry their baby.  Forced with the prospect of returning back to Colombia, and also forfeiting her dreams of practicing law, Sofia accepts the proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the pregnancy Sofia forms a bond with Neil Gardner, the doctor who examined her after the car accident.  The two become close, but she fails to tell Neil about both her marriage to Jesse and her arrangement with the Baumans.  Neil naturally has questions as Sofia's stomach begins to grow.  To complicate matters further Sofia is not so sure she wants to give the baby to the Baumans, especially as she gains a taste of motherhood by her interaction with Max, the foster kid that lives next door. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShowing On: MBC MAX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYear: 2005\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuration: 96 minutes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy, Romance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStarring: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAngie Cepeda\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKen Marino\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMartita Roca\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNora Dunn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJim Piddock\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMax Burkholder\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrad Rowe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirector: Shane Edelman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRating: Rated R for explicit language, including some sexual references.","creator_id":1,"presentationStyle":1}
